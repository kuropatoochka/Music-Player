I can buy myself flowers <br>
Write my name in the sand <br>
Talk to myself for hours <br>
Say things you don't understand <br>

Can love me better <br>
Oh, I <br><br>
I didn't wanna leave you <br>
I didn't wanna fight <br>
Started to cry, but then remembered I <br><br>
I can buy myself flowers (oh) <br>
Write my name in the sand (mm) <br>
Talk to myself for hours (yeah) <br>

Yeah, I can love me better than <br>
Yeah, I can love me better than you can <br><br>
Can love me better <br>
I can love me better, baby (oh) <br>
Can love me better <br>
I can love me better (than you can), baby <br>
Can love me better <br>
