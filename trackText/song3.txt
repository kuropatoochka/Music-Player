Doesn't this guitar sound so good?<br>
Mm, mm, mm<br>
So sweet<br><br>
Living in this big blue world<br>
With my head up in outer space<br>
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K<br>
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K<br>
When I see trouble come my way<br>
I be makin' lemonade<br>
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K<br>
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (mm, mm)<br><br>
Hey little lady, I know you're feelin' crazy (woo)<br>
All your other friends are busy makin' them babies (ew)<br>
Been out in the real world, don't like how it's tasting (nah)<br>
Let me change your mind with my little old saying (what?)<br>
Two-four-six-eight, who do we appreciate? (Mm)<br>
Put some sugar in my water (yah), 'cause we makin' Minute Maid (woo)<br>
Fuck to all the hate (uh), do a shimmy-shay (woah)<br>
Throw a middle finger up down the inner state<br><br>
Living in this big blue world (blue world)<br><br>
With my head up in outer space (outer space)<br>
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (A-O-K)<br>
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (mm, mm)<br>
When I see trouble come my way (my way)<br>
I be makin' lemonade (lemonade)<br>
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K<br>
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (mm, mm)<br><br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na (A-O, A-O-K)<br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na (A-O, A-O-K)<br><br>
I'd be lyin' if I said I knew the way (yo. I'd be lyin')<br>
I just eat shit and pretend that it's gourmet (ooh, lala)<br>
I've had terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad days<br>
But I'm a G, can't you see that I will always be all A-O-K<br><br>
Uh-uh, uh, A-O-K<br>
I'm gon' be uh-uh, uh, A-O-K<br>
You gon' be uh-uh, uh, A-O-K<br>
We gon' be uh-uh, uh, A-O-K<br>
Sugar, sugar<br><br>
Living in this big blue world (blue world)<br>
With my head up in outer space (outer space)<br>
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (A-O-K)<br>
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (mm, mm)<br>
When I see trouble come my way (my way)<br>
I be makin' lemonade (lemonade)<br>
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K<br>
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K<br><br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na (A-O, A-O-K)<br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na (A-O, A-O-K)
